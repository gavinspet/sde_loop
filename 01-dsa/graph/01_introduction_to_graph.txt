1. Directed graph - Undirected graph
2. Nodes or vertex: they are represented by numbers
3. Edge - (directed edge - Undirected edge) directed (u -> v and v ->u) 
4. cycles in a graph - start from a node and end at that node
5. cyclic graph - acyclic graph
6. Path - contain lot of vertices and nodes and each of them are reachable
7. A node can not appear twice in a Path
8. Degrees in a graph - number of edges going inside a node
9. For Undirected graph - degree = no. of edges attached to it
10. Total degree of a graph = 2*edges
11. InDegree-OutDegree 
12. Weight to an edge
13. if Weight not assigned then weight = 1 unit
