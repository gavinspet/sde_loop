// In C++, semaphores are used to manage access to a shared resource
// by multiple threads in a concurrent programming environment.
// A semaphore maintains a counter that indicates the number of available
// resources or permits. Threads can acquire or release these permits,
// ensuring controlled access to the shared resource.

// While the C++ Standard Library (as of C++20) does not include native support
// for semaphores, they are available in the form of std::counting_semaphore and
// std::binary_semaphore in the C++20 standard. If you are using a pre-C++20
// standard, you can use third-party libraries like Boost or implement
// semaphores manually using mutexes and condition variables.
